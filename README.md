# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The analysis is based on passenger data including age, gender, ticket class, and other relevant features.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handling missing values
   * Converting categorical variables
   * Dropping unnecessary columns

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Understanding survival rates by gender, class, age group
   * Correlation analysis

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Feature selection

4. **Modeling**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest Classifier
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * Decision Tree

5. **Evaluation**

   * Accuracy Score
   * Confusion Matrix
   * Cross-validation

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
